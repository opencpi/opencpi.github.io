This directory is a place to put all release content that is meant to be accessed as web content.
The content for each release is in its own directory.  This could be done with git branches etc., but
github does not support accessing web content beyond a single branch, so we master.

We have a "latest" symlink here, and we have the symlink for the top-level index.html pointing to
"releases/latest/index.html.
